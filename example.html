      <h1>Drum-Taps</h1>

      <p>First O songs for a prelude,<br>
      Lightly strike on the stretch'd tympanum pride and joy in my city,<br>
      How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,<br>
      How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,<br>
      (O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!<br>
      O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than<br>
                steel!)<br>
      How you sprang—how you threw off the costumes of peace with<br>
                indifferent hand,<br>
      How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard<br>
                in their stead,<br>
      How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of<br>
                soldiers,)<br>
      How Manhattan drum-taps led.</p>

      <p>Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,<br>
      Forty years as a pageant, still unawares the lady of this teeming and<br>
                turbulent city,<br>
      Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,<br>
      With her million children around her, suddenly,<br>
      At dead of night, at news from the south,<br>
      Incens'd struck with clinch'd hand the pavement.</p>

      <p>A shock electric, the night sustain'd it,<br>
      Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour'd out its myriads.<br>
      From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,<br>
      Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.</p>

      <p>To the drum-taps prompt,<br>
      The young men falling in and arming,<br>
      The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith's<br>
                hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)<br>
      The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the<br>
                court,<br>
      The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing<br>
                the reins abruptly down on the horses' backs,<br>
      The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all<br>
                leaving;<br>
      Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,<br>
      The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their<br>
                accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,<br>
      Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musketbarrels,<br>
      The white tents cluster in camps, the arm'd sentries around, the<br>
                sunrise cannon and again at sunset,<br>
      Arm'd regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark<br>
                from the wharves,<br>
      (How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with<br>
                their guns on their shoulders!<br>
      How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and<br>
                their clothes and knapsacks cover'd with dust!)<br>
      The blood of the city up—arm'd! arm'd! the cry everywhere,<br>
      The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the<br>
                public buildings and stores,<br>
      The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his<br>
                mother,<br>
      (Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain<br>
                him,)<br>
      The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the<br>
                way,<br>
      The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their<br>
                favorites,<br>
      The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along, rumble<br>
                lightly over the stones,<br>
      (Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,<br>
      Soon unlimber'd to begin the red business;)<br>
      All the mutter of preparation, all the determin'd arming,<br>
      The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,<br>
      The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no<br>
                mere parade now;<br>
      War! an arm'd race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning<br>
                away;<br>
      War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm'd race is advancing to<br>
                welcome it.</p>

      <p>Mannahatta a-march—and it's O to sing it well!<br>
      It's O for a manly life in the camp.<br>

      <p>And the sturdy artillery,<br>
      The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,<br>
      Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for<br>
                courtesies merely,<br>
      Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)</p>

      <p>And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,<br>
      Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,<br>
      Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown'd amid<br>
                all your children,<br>
      But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.</p>
