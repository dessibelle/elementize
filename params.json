Add `elementize.min.js` and `elementize.min.css` to you markup\r\n2. Use `$(...).elementize();` on the elements you would like to elementize \r\n\r\nThe below code illustrates an example usage, all available options and their default values.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n$('p').elementize({\r\n    matchCase: true,            // Matches only \"Be\", not \"BE\", \"be\" or \"bE\"\r\n    numberAsSpan: false,        // Inserts atomic number in a span element rather than data-attribute and :after pseudo-element\r\n    style: 'colorize'           // Any of the following coloring styles: 'colorize', 'breaking-bad', 'clear'\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Known limitations\r\n\r\nCurrently all each text node replaced will be wrapped in a `span`, which in turn contains another `span.elementize-element`, while it should be possible to just skip the top level `span` and append both replaced and untouched text nodes to directly to their original parent node. This is due to the way replacements are made, and the only drawback appears to be superfluous `span` elements.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
